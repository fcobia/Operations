An `Procedure` subclass which enables the grouping
of other operations. Use `GroupOperation`s to associate
related operations together, thereby creating higher
levels of abstractions.

Additionally, `GroupOperation`s are useful as a way
of creating Operations which may repeat themselves before
subsequent operations can run. For example, authentication
operations.
