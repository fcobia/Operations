/**
Abstract base Procedure class which subclasses `NSOperation`.

Procedure builds on `NSOperation` in a few simple ways.

1. For an instance to become `.Ready`, all of its attached
`OperationCondition`s must be satisfied.

2. It is possible to attach `OperationObserver`s to an instance,
to be notified of lifecycle events in the operation.

     # Access the logger for this Procedure
     The `log` property can be used as the interface to access the logger.
     e.g. to output a message with `LogSeverity.Info` from inside
     the `Procedure`, do this:

    ```swift
    log.info("This is my message")
    ```

     To adjust the instance severity of the LoggerType for the
     `Procedure`, access it via this property too:

    ```swift
    log.severity = .Verbose
    ```

     The logger is a very simple type, and all it does beyond
     manage the enabled status and severity is send the String to
     a block on a dedicated serial queue. Therefore to provide custom
     logging, set the `logger` property:

     ```swift
     log.logger = { message in sendMessageToAnalytics(message) }
     ```

     By default, the Logger's logger block is the same as the global
     LogManager. Therefore to use a custom logger for all Operations:

     ```swift
     LogManager.logger = { message in sendMessageToAnalytics(message) }

    // MARK: - Disable Automatic Finishing

    /**
     Ability to override Operation's built-in finishing behavior, if a
     subclass requires full control over when finish() is called.

     Used for GroupOperation to implement proper .Finished state-handling
     (only finishing after all child operations have finished).

     The default behavior of Procedure is to automatically call finish()
     when:
        (a) it's cancelled, whether that occurs:
            - prior to the Procedure starting
              (in which case, Procedure will skip calling execute())
            - on another thread at the same time that the operation is
              executing
        (b) when willExecuteObservers log errors

     To ensure that an Procedure subclass does not finish until the
     subclass calls finish():
     call `super.init(disableAutomaticFinishing: true)` in the init.

     IMPORTANT: If disableAutomaticFinishing == TRUE, the subclass is
     responsible for calling finish() in *ALL* cases, including when the
     operation is cancelled.

     You can react to cancellation using WillCancelObserver/DidCancelObserver
     and/or checking periodically during execute with something like:

     ```swift
     guard !cancelled else {
        // do any necessary clean-up
        finish()    // always call finish if automatic finishing is disabled
        return
     }
